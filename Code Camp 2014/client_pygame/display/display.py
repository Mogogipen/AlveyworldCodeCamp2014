class Display(BaseDisplay):
    """
    This class controls all of the drawing of the screen
    for your game.  The process of drawing a screen is
    to first draw the background, and then draw everything
    that goes on top of it.  If two items are drawn in the
    same place, then the last item drawn will be the one
    that is visible.

    The screen is a 2 dimensional grid of pixels, with the
    origin (0,0) located at the top-left of the screen, and
    x values increase to the right and y values increase as
    you go down.  The y values are opposite of what you learned
    in your math classes.

    Documentation on drawing in pygame is available here:
    http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html

    The methods in this class are:
    __init__ creates data members (variables) that are used
        in the rest of the methods of this class.  This is
        useful for defining colors and sizes, loading image
        or sound files, creating fonts, etc.  Basically,
        any one time setup.

    paint_game controls the drawing of the screen while the
        game is in session.  This is responsible for making
        sure that any information, whether graphics, text, or
        images are drawn to the screen.

    paint_waiting_for_game controls the drawing of the screen
        after you have requested to join a game, but before
        the game actually begins.
    
    paint_game_over controls the drawing of the screen after
        the game has been won, but before the game goes away.
        This is a short (3-5 second) period.

    process_event controls handling events that occur in the
        game, that aren't represented by objects in the game
        engine.  This includes things like collisions,
        objects dying, etc.  This would be a great place to
        play an audio file when missiles hit objects.

    paint_pregame controls the drawing of the screen before
        you have requested to join a game.  This would usually
        allow the user to know the options available for joining
        games.

    Method parameters and data members of interest in these methods:
    self.width is the width of the screen in pixels.
    self.height is the height of the screen in pixels.
    self.* many data members are created in __init__ to set up
        values for drawing, such as colors, text size, etc.
    surface is the screen surface to draw to.
    control is the control object that is used to
        control the game using user input.  It may
        have data in it that influences the display.
    engine contains all of the game information about the current
        game.  This includes all of the information about all of
        the objects in the game.  This is where you find all
        of the information to display.
    event is used in process_event to communicate what
        interesting thing occurred.
    
    Note on text display:  There are 3 methods to assist
    in the display of text.  They are inherited from the
    BaseDisplay class.  See client/base_display.py.
